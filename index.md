### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorites because even though it was easy it was our very first lab. My partner and I had never coded anything so this was our first experience. Always very curious to learn how to code this was an exciting moment for me and enjoyable despite it being just the basics like printing out text. 

* Lab 8
    
    Lab 8, part 1 was very enjoyable for me because I havee always wanted to try something similar like that with pattern loops with a different output. Using the resources given in class and in the lab I was able to create my own project. This one was very enjoyable to code despite being a little confused in the beginning. 

* Lab 9
    
    Lab 9, part 1 The best part of this lab for me was my partner and my teamwork. I was a little lost through this lab with writing a code to call for a min function, but whatever I was confused about my partner explained it to me. After this, I had a full understanding of writing code that would call for another function
